* Skeleton Sinatra App

This is a sinatra app that follows some conventions that I like to use
when building web applications. It's optimised for database-backed web
apps rather than APIs, and as such features:

- Twitter bootstrap
- jquery
- Capybara for acceptance testing
- Minitest
- Application config in =config/settings.yml=

** Todo

Things I want to add:

- Datamapper for persistence
- A pry-based console
- Authentication (using omniauth?) and a user model.
